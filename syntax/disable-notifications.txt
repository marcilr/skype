Disable notificiations


By default Skype creates annoying individual popups for 
all users in your group.  Unless required this can easily
be disabled.  It required right-click each user in my
group and unchecking "Tag for Status Change Alerts."

Did not find a way to do this for all group members.  Only
had 6 people in my group total so not difficutl to do.


Click "Tools" in the main menu of your Skype application, and
then select "Options" in the drop-down menu.  A dialog box with
options launches in the application. Uncheck in the main panel
all the types of notification pop-ups you wish to disable, and
then click "Save" to save your settings.
